# sudoku

This project contains the Python code for both a backtracking algorithm used to solve a pre-determined sudoku board, as well as a GUI that will display the board for easier use. The GUI was provided as a template, minor adjustments were made to suit the needs of my program. The Cube class, Grid class, and Redraw function were provided by TechWithTim in an online tutorial found here: https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-programming/sudoku-solver-backtracking/, and were NOT written by me. All other code was written by myself.
